<h2>NATURE</h2>
        <div id="d0">
              <p> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the
                phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only,
                part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category
                from other natural phenomena.[1]
        
                The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
                qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura
                is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the
                intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own
                accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
                original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
                (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
                ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
                passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
                became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by
                some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history
                (Hegel, Marx).

    <h1>HTML</h1>
    
    <div id="d1">
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for
            the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents
            by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other
            items.
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input />
            directly
            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
            surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
            not
            display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <div id="d2">
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
            alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
            as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share
            the file and its formatting.

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
            than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
